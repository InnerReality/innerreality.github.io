My motivation for the "Homelab Setup" series is to document what I've learned so that I can refer to it later. To be honest, I watched multiple videos and read multiple blogs to compare and select the most suitable homeserver setup that I wanted, i.e., use services that are open-source, customizable and has good community support for learning and trouble-shooting. In the worst possible case that I lose my homeserver, I can still reconfigure a new homeserver with this information.
